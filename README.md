# CatFishNet-PyTorch

A PyTorch-based convolutional neural network for detecting cats and fish in images.

## Overview

CatFishNet-PyTorch is a deep learning project that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as either containing a cat or a fish. This project demonstrates the use of PyTorch for image classification tasks and serves as a practical example of binary classification in computer vision.

## About Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep learning models particularly effective for image analysis and computer vision tasks. Key features of CNNs include:

1. Convolutional layers: These layers apply filters to input images to detect features like edges, textures, and shapes.

2. Pooling layers: These reduce the spatial dimensions of the data, helping to make the network more computationally efficient and invariant to small translations.

3. Fully connected layers: These layers typically appear at the end of the network and use the features extracted by convolutional and pooling layers to make the final classification decision.

4. Local connectivity: Unlike fully connected networks, CNNs exploit spatially local correlation by enforcing a local connectivity pattern between neurons of adjacent layers.

5. Parameter sharing: This principle helps to reduce the number of parameters in the model, making it more efficient and less prone to overfitting.

In this project, we leverage these properties of CNNs to effectively distinguish between images of cats and fish.
